  - Click: **"Clear cache and retry deploy"**

- [ ] Trigger new deployment:
  - Option 1: Push to Git (auto-deploys)
  - Option 2: Click **"Trigger deploy"** in Netlify
  - Option 3: Run `netlify deploy --prod`

- [ ] Wait for build to complete (2-5 minutes)

- [ ] Check build logs for errors:
  - Go to: **Deploys** tab
  - Click latest deploy
  - Read the build log
  - Look for "Build succeeded" message

---

## ‚úÖ MongoDB Atlas Checklist

- [ ] Database `civil360` exists
- [ ] Users collection has data (run `npm run populate` if empty)
- [ ] Network Access allows Netlify:
  - Go to: **Network Access** in MongoDB Atlas
  - Add IP: **0.0.0.0/0** (Allow from anywhere)
  - Or add Netlify's specific IP ranges

- [ ] Database user credentials are correct
- [ ] Connection string in `MONGODB_URI` is valid

## ‚úÖ Post-Deployment Testing

### Test 1: Site Loads
- [ ] Visit: https://civil360.netlify.app
- [ ] Page loads without errors
- [ ] No console errors (F12 ‚Üí Console tab)

### Test 2: API Routes Work
- [ ] Open DevTools (F12)
- [ ] Go to Network tab

- [ ] Click "Se connecter"
- [ ] Should show error message
- [ ] Should NOT crash or show 500 error

## ‚úÖ Verification Commands

Run these locally to verify before deploying:

```bash
# Check Git status
git status

# Test build locally
npm run build

# Test production build locally
npm start
# Then visit http://localhost:3000

# Check for TypeScript errors
npm run check

# View environment variables (local)
cat .env.example
```

## ‚ùå Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: 404 on API routes
**Solution:**
- Clear Netlify build cache
- Verify latest code is pushed to Git

- Verify environment variables are set
- Check Netlify function logs

### Issue: "Service de base de donn√©es indisponible"
**Solution:**
